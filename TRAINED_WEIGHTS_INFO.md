The trained weights can be found at `https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-4499850`.
The repository contains the network weights for StyleGAN2 [1] models trained on the following data:
1) 200676 T1 and T2 weighted MR brain images from the FastMRI Initiative Database [2] and 866 T1 and T2 weighted MR brain images from the TCIA Brain Tumor Progression dataset [3,4]. The output image size is 256x256. 
    - Name of the weights file: `stylegan2-FastMRIT1T2-config-h.pkl`
    - Real samples from the dataset: `reals-FastMRIT1T2.png`
    - Samples from the model: `fakes-stylegan2-FastMRIT1T2-config-h.png`
2) 164741 T1 and T2 weighted MR brain images from the FastMRI Initiative Database [2], 686 T1 and T2 weighted MR brain images from the TCIA Brain Tumor Progression dataset [3,4], 2206 T1 and T2 weighted images from the TCIA-GBM dataset [4,5], and 36978 T2 weighted images from the OASIS-3 dataset [6]. Output image size 256x256. 
    - Name of the weights file: `stylegan2-CompMRIT1T2-config-f.pkl`
    - Real samples from the dataset: `reals-CompMRIT1T2.png`
    - Samples from the model: `fakes-stylegan2-CompMRIT1T2-config-f.png`
3) 70000 images from the Flickr Faces HQ (FFHQ) dataset [7]. Output image size 128x128x3. 
    - Name of the weights file: `stylegan2-FFHQ-config-f.pkl`
    - Real samples from the dataset: `reals-FFHQ.png`
    - Samples from the model: `fakes-stylegan2-FFHQ-config-f.png`
None of the datasets themselves are included in this repository.
