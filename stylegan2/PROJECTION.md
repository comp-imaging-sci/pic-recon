# Projecting images onto the extended latent-space of StyleGAN2

The procedure to project images onto the extended latent space of the StyleGAN2 is adapted from [1]. In order to project images placed in `../pic_recon/prior_images/brain/` onto the extended dlatent space of a StyleGAN2, run `run_projector.sh`. For additional details, refer to `run_projector.sh`, `run_projector.py`, `projector.py`, and the following reference.
